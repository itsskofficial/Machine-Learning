## About The Project

DigRec is a digit recognition project utilizing machine learning, with a Flask backend for model serving and a Next.js frontend for user interaction. The project allows users to draw or input digits and employs a trained machine learning model to recognize and classify the input.

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [Python](htttps://python.org)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* **pip:**
  
  Ensure you have Python installed, as pip comes bundled with Python distributions.

  ```sh
  # To upgrade pip to the latest version, run:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip

## Installation

### Flask Backend

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itsskofficial/Machine-Learning.git

2. **Enter into the Flask directory**
   ```sh
   cd Projects/DigRec/backend

3. **Install libraries**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Start the Flask server**
   ```sh
   python app.py

### Next.js Frontend

1. **Enter into the frontend directory**
   ```sh
   cd Projects/DigRec/frontend

2. **Install the libraries**
   ```sh
   npm install

3. **Start the Next.js client**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   
## Usage

DigRec is a user-friendly digit recognition tool that allows users to draw or input digits, and the machine learning model will recognize and classify the input. The Flask backend serves the machine learning model, while the Next.js frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
