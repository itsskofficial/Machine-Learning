## About The Project

![Screen Shot](lending-prediction.png)

LendPredict is a machine learning project aimed at predicting loan repayment based on borrower features. Leveraging Python and popular libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit Learn, the project utilizes a trained machine learning model to provide insights into whether a borrower is likely to pay back the loan.

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* **pip:**
  
  Ensure you have Python installed, as pip comes bundled with Python distributions.

  ```sh
  # To upgrade pip to the latest version, run:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip


### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/itsskofficial/Machine-Learning.git
    ```

2. **Enter into the directory**
    ```sh
    cd Projects/LendPredict
    ```

3. **Install pip packages**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

LendPredict is a tool designed to predict loan repayment based on borrower features. The project employs machine learning to analyze the provided features and generate predictions, aiding in decision-making processes related to lending.
